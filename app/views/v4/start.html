      <p>The Building Safety Regulator will tell you when you need to apply for a building assessment certificate. You can only apply when BSR directs you to.</p>

      <p>It is the duty of the principal accountable person to ensure the application is submitted within 28 days of being directed by email to apply.</p>

      <p>Only the principal accountable person, or someone authorised to act for them may submit an application.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What you will need</h2>

      <p>You will need to upload:</p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>safety case report</li>
        <li>an outline of your mandatory occurrence reporting system</li>
        <li>resident engagement strategy</li>
      </ul>

      <p>You will need to declare that you are keeping all of the relevant people, such as other accountable persons, up to date.</p>

      <p>You will need to provide details so we can send you invoices. You will be charged for the work undertaken to assess your application.</p>

      <p>You will also need to pay the application charge of £288. You can pay this by card or invoice. Your application will not be accepted as valid until you have paid this charge.</p>
