<p>Greenways Limited must apply for a building assessment certificate for Chester House, within the next 28 days.</p>

<p>We have told the named contact at Greenways Limited that they must do this.</p>

<p>Because you have access to the application for this building, the named contact at Greenways Limited should instruct you to do one of the following:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>submit the application for them</li>
    <li>make someone at Greenways Limited the user of the service so they can submit it themselves</li>
</ul>

<p>After they have instructed you, you can do either of these at: <a href="start">www.register-a-high-rise-building.service.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<p>Your application reference is HRB123456789.</p>

<p>Find out what must be included in the application at <a href="#">www.gov.uk/guidance/building-assessment-certification</a>.</p>
