      <h1 class="govuk-heading-l">Charges for assessing your BAC application</h1>

      <p>You will be asked to pay an initial application charge of £288 to accompany your application for a Building Assessment Certificate (BAC). You can choose to pay this either by card or invoice.</p>

      <p>The assessment of your BAC application will incur further ongoing charges. The BSR will charge you £144 per person for every hour we spend assessing your application. We will also charge you for time spent by other relevant authorities or third parties assessing your BAC application. We’ll send a monthly invoice by email for these charges and therefore require your invoice details.</p>

      <p>As the Principal Accountable Person please provide us with a contact who you want to receive and pay the invoices on your behalf.</p>
